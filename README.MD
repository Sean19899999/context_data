 Contributing Editor comments: 

 Dear Dr. Zhou:
 I have received reviews of your paper titled: “Role of marine bivalves in the oceanic carbon cycle: physiological processes, carbon budgets and ecosystem perspectives” co-authored with H. Li, J. Liang, H. Liu, Y. Li, L. Chen, Y. Guo, and S. Liang.

 The Reviewers acknowledge the topic studied is of interest, however they also identify a number of problems that fundamentally cripple the paper, such as basic conceptual errors and lack of novel insights/guidance/advancement in relation to other existing review papers as this one. I have myself carefully gone over your manuscript and I must say I agree with this sentiment. Unfortunately, the paper has major flaws that prohibit publication in MEPS and, as such, I must turn it down from further consideration for publication in MEPS.

 I am sorry for the disappointing news, but I hope the feedback provided helps you move forward with this and other manuscripts. I send you my best wishes with your future endeavors.

 Sincerely
 Just Cebrian, Contributing Editor

 Reviewer 1 report:

 March 5, 2024

 To the MEPS Contributing Editor,

 Re: Evaluation of “Role of marine bivalves in the oceanic carbon cycle: physiological processes, carbon budgets and ecosystem perspectives”

 The authors have attempted to cover a broad range of factors/issues important for evaluating the role of shellfish vis-à-vis atmospheric CO2 impacts (with additional coverage of other greenhouse gases). Broadly, I applaud efforts to organize and constrain the diverse, somewhat complicated, and sometimes non-intuitive, processes by which shellfish add or remove CO2 to/from the atmosphere. I agree that uncertainty and confusion remain common – even among marine scientists – in discussions regarding the climate impacts of shellfish reef growth/destruction. 

 Despite my positive impression regarding the opportunity for a review manuscript to fill an important niche, I do think this manuscript should be rejected by MEPS for several primarily reasons:

The manuscript adds confusion, rather than clarifies, the effect of shell biosysnthesis on atmospheric CO2. The literature is fairly clear that the biosynthesis of calcium carbonate liberates protons from bicarbonate and subsequently contributes to the formation of excess carbonic followed by venting of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (e.g., Ware et al. 1992, among many others). There are several instances within this manuscript where the authors seem to acknowledge this. 

 Yet, the manuscript also repeatedly suggests “potential for carbon sequestration through the calcification process” (ln 63 – but appearing several times throughout manuscript). Indeed, subsection 2.2.1 (Calcification), under section 2.2. (Potential carbon sink physiological processes), suggests that carbon in shell represents a “sequestration” pathway. Although carbon is buried via shell, the literature is clear that this is NOT a pathway that equates to reduced atmospheric CO2. Rather the literature specifies that burying shell has no further direct impacts on atmospheric CO2, but probably precludes the erosion and dissolution of shell material that would return CO2 concentrations to pre-shell-formation (i.e. lower) levels. In this context, pulling shell out of the water (discussed in manuscript in the context of harvest/mariculture without sufficient clarity/accuracy regarding inorganic carbon chemistry) is the same functionally as burying shell in marine sediments vis-à-vis atmospheric CO2 effects. 

 Conversely, the manuscript fails to explain a clear pathway by which shell formation (then burial or removal) is a sink for atmospheric sink. From my reading of the literature, I think the authors are confusing/confounding two things: (a) not all carbon (esp in the form of calcium carbonate) burial is synonymous with atmospheric CO2 drawdown – if that was the case, coral reefs would receive much more attention as blue carbon habitat. In this context, it’s perhaps a poor wording choice to treat “burial” and “sequestration” interchangeably, given the applied context in which the latter term is used relative to climate change; and (b) biosynthesis of shell DOES NOT affect total DIC in a way that shifts the flux of CO2 between air and water. Instead, biosynthesis of shell DOES affect pH in a way that appreciably shifts the flux of CO2 toward air from water (via the pathways outlined in this manuscript) (sensu Van Dam et al. 2021 in the context of seagrass habitat). If the authors think my interpretation is wrong, a clearer mechanistic explanation in the manuscript is needed regarding how shell burial is an atmospheric CO2 sink (versus a pool of buried carbon).

A primary goal of this review appears to be to organize the key processes that future researchers must account for in a holistic framework of shellfish impacts vis-à-vis atmospheric CO2. As constructed, however, the manuscript still seems very piecemeal and potentially incomplete– I actually exited the manuscript perhaps a little more unsure of what is necessary and sufficient to parameterize shellfish impacts on atmospheric CO2. 

 For instance, the manuscript discusses shellfish respiration (certainly appropriate), but respiration is a component of all blue carbon habitats – including the foundation species such as marsh, seagrass, and mangroves. Also, these habitat generally support increased densities of consumers (heterotrophs) in/around those foundation species, thus impacting respiration. In an “ecosystem context”, why exclude this “ecosystem-level respiration”. Still, the key requirement is that local production exceeds respiration. The burial or organic carbon within/under shellfish reefs is an indication that the producer-shellfish system is functioning ‘net autotrophic’. As the literature directly, this “net autotrophic” determination is what is key, but not sufficiently described in this manuscript. 

 The figures include a lot of good /appropriate details, but viewed collectively, actually confused rather than clarified which processes must consistently be measured to determine the effects of shellfish systems on atmospheric CO2. Perhaps a box model or table would be more instructive than these series of diagrammatic images. 

Related to point 2 above, the manuscript is organized poorly. For instance, there are multiple, disconnected sections that seem to divert into a very applied conversation about the carbon-related services of mariculture operations (e.g., section 3, section 6). This made the manuscript appear diffuse (and likely unnecessarily long). 

 Similarly, why is section 5.1 (Coupling bivalves and phytoplankton) not included under section 4 (Bivalve oyster budget in ecosystem context)? Certainly the former is a fundamental aspect of the latter. 

 As in other papers, perhaps the organization should be broken under broad headings tracking pools of ‘inorganic’ and ‘organic’ carbon…? 

 There are many line-level issues that take away from the thrusts I suspect the authors wish to make. In some cases, these issues not only muddle messages, but potentially lead to contradictory arguments. Those line-level comments are detailed below:

 Ln 1 (Title): Replace “oceanic” with “marine”.

 Ln 9: I thought the abstract was well written

 Ln 30: “Sciences et al. is not formatted correctly (Sciences is not a person).

 Ln 50: Explain how these three mechanisms affect CO2 solubility.

 Ln 55: “other carbon fixation methods” is vague. Please clarify.

 Ln 81: See major comment #1 above – this text is confusing/blurring terminology related to burial, sequestration, and atmospheric CO2 drawdown.

 Ln 97: What is meant by “net carbon source” – source of atmospheric CO2?

 Ln 105: Again, what is a “carbon source”?

 Lns 108-111: I could not understand the pathway/rationale here, and there were no citations provided to support this text.

 Ln 156-158: This text is unclear – shell dissolution is NOT ocean acidification (see line 171, where the text is clear/correct). No citations were provided to support/clarify the text here. 

 Ln 157: “converting CO2 into a carbon sink” – this wording does not make sense to me.

 Ln 174: “dissolution of atmospheric CO2” = ??? 

 Ln 178: There is no clear rationale/mechanism by which harvested shells serve as carbon sinks (and sinks relative to what?).

 Ln 182: Again, by what mechanism – what kind of sink?

 Ln 185: Unlike lns 178 and 182, this text is on solid footing.

 Ln 196: What is “carbon loss”?

 Ln 200: As written: “The calcification process associated with shell formation both releases and captures carbon”… with regards to atmospheric CO2 (atmospheric carbon), it ONLY releases carbon (per comments above).

 Ln 203: “calcification storage” should be removed from this equation.

 Ln 214 (also Lns 421, 433, 456): This citation is Fodrie et al. (not Joel et al.)

 Ln 224: Specify the breakdown of inorganic versus organic carbon in shells. Also, what citation supports this statement?

 Ln 228-233: I think all of this text highlights why shell is NOT both a source and sink for atmospheric CO2 (see major comment #1 above).

 Ln 238: If “tissue production” is intended for human consumption in aquaculture, this carbon is meant to be respired, so would seem invalid for carbon credit trading…?

 Ln 253: “Economic bivalves” reads awkwardly to me.

 Ln 267: I do not think bivalves can be categorized as “economic” vs “ecological restoration” species. For instance, eastern oysters are both. A person might categorize their purposes of ‘adding’ shellfish into a waterbody as motivated by either “seafood production” or “ecosystem services” or other…

 Ln 295: Sediments/biodeposits should be included along with shells and tissues.

 Ln 356: What is “DIC morphology”?

 Ln 373: What is “individual cultivation”? Should it be “single-species cultivation”. And if so, does it mean either algal-only and shellfish-only, or just shellfish only?

 Ln 377: What is “single cultivation”? Should it be “single-species cultivation”. And if so, does it mean either algal-only and shellfish-only, or just shellfish only?

 Ln 392: Oyster reefs may also serve as bulwarks protecting marsh (another blue carbon habitat) – Ridge et al. (2015) Maximizing oyster-reef growth supports green infrastructure with accelerating sea-level rise 

 Lns 444-456: This text somewhat repeats earlier text, and is very similar to text in Fodrie et al. (2017) – which the authors cite – so I wonder if it’s even worth including here...

 Ln 459: Is it appropriate to say that bivalves/ other consumers “fix” carbon? I thought that was a term reserved for primary producers.

 Ln 468: Should be “Fodrie et al. (2017) suggest”

 Ln 514: Neither “CO2 is a mechanism through which carbon is sequestered” nor “returned to the atmosphere through photosynthesis” makes any sense.

 Ln 518: Are the authors attempting to convey “1:1 relationship between inorganic and organic carbon”? The existing text is not clear.

 Ln 530: “bivalves themselves” reads awkwardly to me.

 Ln 609: What is “waste” referring to here (feces, other?)?

 Ln 614: “released of stored carbon into the environment” – by what mechanism / provide further detail.

 Ln 626: Dissolution would actually contribute to removal of atmospheric CO2 – this is indeed stated earlier in manuscript. But here, it’s written as dissolution “releases stored carbon” – readers will likely take this to imply that dissolution adds to atmospheric CO2. Very confusing. 

 I apologize for not being able to provide a more supportive review of this manuscript, but I do with the authors good luck moving forward with this ms,

 Reviewer 2 report:

 The manuscript 'Role of marine bivalves in the oceanic carbon cycle: Physiological processes, carbon budgets and ecosystem perspectives' is a review focused on the role of bivalves in the marine carbon cycle. The review contains a lot of information, but I am not convinced that it advances the field. There are already several quite similar reviews (or data papers) that have been published (e.g. Jansen et al, 2020; Feng et al, 2023; van der Schatte Olivier et al 2018; Li et al, 2023; Zavell et al, 2023; Jones et al, 2022; Lee et al, 2023), and I don't feel that this one synthesises the information to provide new/useful insight, or provides novel guidance for future work. In particular, much of the information in sections 4, 5 & 6 has already been synthesised in earlier papers. I think that the authors need to make clear at the start what they are adding to the existing body of literature in this research area. I have included some general comments below and also supplied an annotated PDF document with detailed comments.
 GENERAL COMMENTS:
 -        Referencing. I found the manuscript (particularly sections 1-3) very low on citations (which is surprising for a review paper).
 -        There seems to be a real disconnection between sections 1-3 and sections 4-7 (both in terms of writing style and content – they are quite repetitive of each other in some places). These sections could almost form stand-alone (separate) papers. Perhaps they were led by different members of the author team? If that is the case, I think that more effort can be made to integrate them into a single cohesive piece of work. At the moment, the aims/focus of the first few sections feels very distinct from that of the last few sections.
 -        I think that the whole manuscript would flow and read better if it was restructured around the main processes (e.g. physiological processes, environmental processes, industrial/aquaculture processes). This would mean that all the relevant information could be brought together in one section (rather than e.g. separating the relevant content into multiple different sections through the paper – that are often not next to each other in the current structure). As an example, in section 2, calcification (and related processes like dissolution) is dealt with in 2.1.1, 2.2.1 and 2.2.3. It would be easier to follow the potential sources and sinks associated with calcification if all of this content was combined into one section – where the evidence is reviewed and a final summary/recommendation or statement about the likely result (i.e. net source or net sink) was made at the end.

 Reviewer 3 report:

 Overall, this paper has a different perspective than the information already out in the field. However the title applies to the ocean as a whole, and many of the examples are actually in special situations, like bivalve algae culture or information from mesocosm experiments. I would recommend changing the title or making it more clear throughout when the data comes from mesocosms and/or might only apply to systems where certain conditions exist. In addition, many citations come from articles in Chinese, with only an English abstract. To make it more accessible to more readers, it might be beneficial to add examples from the literature where the paper is entirely in English. I am not saying to remove those citations, just to add more. For example, I know there are papers that talk about the same topic as the cited Fang et al. 2011. I feel some sections need more clarity or commentary given.

 General comments
 Spacing, there are places were there aren’t enough spaces and other places where there are extra spaces. Formatting of citations throughout is not consistent, along with the citation format in the references section.

 Comments on parts of the paper
 Page 3, line 65, the word order doesn’t make sense here, did you mean in order to or something else?
 Page 4, line 71, dual carbon really isn’t described anywhere, from what I understand this a program in China, so readers outside the country might need more information
 Page 4, line 80, releases a certain amount of CO2. Certain is a vague word, is there an actual number, or should it be reworded to say is dependent on conditions like salinity and temperature and varies between X and Y?
 Page 5, line 103, the paragraph ends with the citations by Han et al., but really no explanation about what is important about this negative correlation. There were specific examples given above for temperature, so maybe something like this for salinity. Or if not available, something more about what this means in the big picture.
 Page 6, line 115, this section talks about aerobic decomposition and feces. I wondered what happens under anerobic conditions as many areas experience hypoxia/anoxia. I also wondered about pseudofeces too. I know pseudofeces is mentioned in later paragraphs, but not really in terms of CO2 production.
 Page 7, line 136, ends with a fact by Alonso et al. 2021, is this into shells, overall? Does this also account for losses from shell dissolution?
 Page 8, line 175, in mentions that harvested bivalves shells are stored on land, I do know in some areas they do use them for reef restoration. I do not know how much, and how this would impact the part that is being discussed here.
 Page 9, line 187, what do you mean by impact the ecosystem’s functionality, what is disrupted, how is it disrupted, what changes?
 Page 9, line 188, typo in Bivalve
 Page 10, line 199, is it only oysters, or is it all bivalves?
 Page 10, lines 200-201, are confusing the animal dies and then we lead into calcification. I am confused about the point that is trying to me made right here
 Page 11 mentions many different methods, shown on figure 1, but there is no commentary about them, the title is a comparison but I don’t see a lot of comparison in the section, it seems this should be expanded more with commentary from the authors.
 Page 12, starting line 247, is talking about cultured and wild bivalves, but the one citation cited is only about mussels, I didn’t know if there were other examples that could be shown here. 
 Page 12, starting line 253, there is a lot of information shared, but nothing is cited?
 Page 12, line 262, absorb is an interesting choice of word here, they don’t really absorb them, maybe uptake?
 Page 13, starting line 277-279 there are facts about bivalves with no citations?
 Page 16, line 332, end with a fact by Smaal et al. about plankton communities being negatively impacted, but there is some commentary missing. Like in what way, why does this matter in the bigger picture?
 Page 16, line 336, the work is in a mesocosm and the whole paper is about the ocean, so it need to be clear that this is a mesocosm work and make it clear how it applies
 Page 16, line 348, is it only inorganic carbon balances, what about organic?
 Page 16-17, section 4.2, this really only applies to co-cultivation systems, there is not much information about areas this isn’t happening, so maybe the title should be adjusted. Are there any data from oceanic areas?
 Page 18, line 379, superior carbon, the word superior would imply compared to something else, so superior to what? (natural systems)
 Page 19, line 406, confirms might not be the best word choice here? Data could confirm, but I am not sure a concept confirms.
 Page 21, line 440, it is referring to the fossil record, but I don’t see anything about fossils in 3B? I am confused by this
 Page 22, line 472, you mention ecosystem services, but don’t mention what those are, not all readers might be aware. I know that you mention them later, but it might be better to mention something here.
 Page 22, line 482 the line starts with a citation and ends with a different citation?
 Page 23, line 485-486, what discrepancies between studies, between Ray & Nicholas, is there a range? This section is confusing with the values.
 Page 24, line 511, ends with a fact from Macreadi et al, so what does this mean
 Page 24, line 517, who is Jackson, we have Zhang and Macreadie as authors around this section?
 Page 26, section 6.1.2, this section is confusing at some points it seems to be alluding that bivalve aquaculture is less than terrestrial and then there is data showing culture of mussels and intertidal oysters are higher, and then data saying that manure management isn’t account for. So I am not getting a clear message. And it could be there isn’t a completely clear message, but how it is written comes across as random facts that aren’t telling me a story/message.
 Page 28, line 605, I am not sure how this fact from Forrest el al. 2009 relates to the cage culture location that the rest of the paragraph is talking about. It isn’t clear.
